        New location, new energy and new milestones, today you all ran 4 miles and total 12 miles this week. Awesome Striders !!! Hope you all attended the gear talk after the run, and learnt about endurance walking/running gear. Remember getting used to the right gear starts way before the race day.

        Thank you to all the Aid Station volunteers!! Itâ€™s a great way to introduce your family and friends to Vibha and have them see what you do on Sunday mornings. (Note: Children over 14 years can volunteer. Below that age, they need to be accompanied by a parent or guardian)

    <p>
        Great job on completing Week 4 - you ran a total of 10 miles this week. Speed Trainees started their workout in full earnest too. You all are getting stronger every week! What’s more - you even topped it off with a smashing, post-run Ice Breaker party!

        <b>Gear Talk</b><br>
        Coaches will be hosting a Gear Talk following the walk/run this Sunday, March 27th. This important session will talk about crucial endurance walking/running gear that we all need to know about and start getting used to. Getting used to the right gear starts way before the race day - please make sure to attend and learn more. Coaches will also have separate discussions for men and women, to discuss specific topics for these groups.

        <b>Speed Coaching</b><br>
        Congratulations to the second batch who attended and got admitted into our inaugural Speed Training - we have had excellent response with over 36 trainees speed training this season. Speed Trainees should have received a separate email with further details on this week’s workouts. Please note we are not accepting any more applications for Speed Coaching.

        <b>Evening Strengthening Sessions (Pilot for 2 weeks)</b><br>
        Based on requests, Coaches are piloting Evening Strengthening sessions at 5:25 PM for the second week this week, on the same days as morning ones (Mon & Weds). You can choose to attend either the morning or evening session.

        <b>Aid Station Volunteering Sign up (for family & friends)</b><br>
        As the runs get longer, we will start putting out an aid station for you all on the trails. We always need volunteers for these - you will be training so please do not put your name there but it’s a great way to introduce your family and friends to Vibha and have them see what you do on Sunday mornings. (Note: Children over 14 years can volunteer. Below that age, they need to be accompanied by a parent or guardian)

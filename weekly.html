        <b>Trials for Family & Friends</b><br>
        Trials are open for 3 more weeks - going through this journey with a friend or family member makes it even more
        sweeter! They can try out the program for up to 1 week. Please spread the word so they can attend a weekend
        session or a full week of their choice - including a weekend session, mentor runs and strengthening sessions.
        Point them to our website or simply bring them to a session with you, and introduce them to us. Trials will
        close on March 19, 2022, so act quick!

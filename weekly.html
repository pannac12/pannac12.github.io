    <p>
        What a wonderful turnout for our first training session! We're anticipating a great season as we work our way to
        that finish line in a few weeks. The weekly update email will be the easiest way for you to keep up with the
        program so please be sure to read every edition. We'll keep it short, promise!
    </p>

    <p>
        For your first week, please read through the Welcome Email and please regularly check the email account that you
        have registered with us. Email will be the primary mode of communication.
    </p>


    <p>
        This is also a good time to connect with your local mentor group, if you have not done so already, details are
        in the Welcome email.</p>

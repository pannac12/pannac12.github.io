        Well done on completing Week 7 of the program. You all ran / walked a total of 13 miles (!!) this week and have already done over 50 miles (!!!) in the program so far - what an amazing milestone! Congratulations on your consistency and determination!

        Many of you also challenged yourself with 3x800m interval paces at Speed Coaching this week. And of course, many unwinded at the fantastic Happy Hours at Big Al’s that even produced 2 unplanned TikTok videos! :)

        <b>Aid Station Volunteering Sign up (for family & friends)</b><br>
        Thank you to all the Aid Station volunteers!! It’s a great way to introduce your family and friends to Vibha and have them see what you do on Sunday mornings. (Note: Children over 14 years can volunteer. Below that age, they need to be accompanied by a parent or guardian)

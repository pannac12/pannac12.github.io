        What an amazing week this one has been - a 3 miler run, your longest weekly mileage so far (7 miles!), foam rolling, fundraising and what’s more, we kicked off our inaugural Speed Training earlier this Tuesday as well. Well done on wrapping up Week 3!
        <br><br>
        Hope you all are enjoying your new runner / walker look!!

        <b>Trials for Family & Friends</b><br>
        Final 1 week for trials. Have you asked your family or friends to come over for a trial yet? Trials and Signups will close on Saturday, March 19, 2022 - so act quick!

        <b>Aid Station Volunteering Sign up (for family & friends)</b><br>
        As the runs get longer, we will start putting out an aid station for you all on the trails. We always need volunteers for these - you will be training so please do not put your name there but it’s a great way to introduce your family and friends to Vibha and have them see what you do on Sunday mornings.

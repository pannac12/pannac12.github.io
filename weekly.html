        Great job on completing your 2 mile run. Also, we had our first Shoe clinic, and many of you have got your first pair. Congratulations! 
        <br><br>
        Now that you have your running shoes, you can rest assured that you've set yourself up for safer, snugger runs going forward. After your first lace-up, take time to walk around the house so your feet and shoes can get to know each other a bit. Your shoes can feel a bit stiff and foreign during your first few runs, and that's okay. For those of you who are still looking to get running shoes, please attend an upcoming shoe clinic.

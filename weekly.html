        <b>Vibha Striders Fundraising Picnic</b><br>
        <p>
            The Vibha Striders Annual Fundraising Picnic is a great opportunity to raise money toward your fundraising goals by offering goods and services, fun and games, to other trainees & their family & friends. Besides offering store bought or homemade food or drinks, you can also consider offering services like: taking photos with props and costumes, singing songs, providing toys and sports, or teaching dances - get creative and bring out the talent in your family! 
        </p>
      
        </p>
            The site itself offers 11 long tables (great for food), 2 tables with sinks (perfect for Chai and drinks), and 5 circular tables with 4 stools each (ideal for face painting, henna tattoos, and cards or board games). We can set up your additional tables on the lawn. The large lawn makes sports possible, so please consider offering lawn games as your fundraiser, like hacky sack, life size Jenga, hoola hoops, Nerf guns, or badminton. 
            <br><br>    
            Your whole family is invited to attend and partake in this fun and festive community atmosphere - bring on the kids and pets too!

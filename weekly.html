        These will be held via Zoom each week: Monday & Wednesday at 6:00 am. Coaches will lead this class, show you the
        workout, and give you guidance on correct form. You only need a yoga mat and a foam roller for these classes (no
        weights or other equipment required). If you don’t already have a foam roller, either 12-inch or longer is
        highly recommended: https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00XM2N06O/

    <p>
        After a very successful Speed Coaching program last season, trainees can expect to improve their ease and
        efficiency of running, an increase in cardiovascular fitness and confidence, and a possible improvement in
        performance. Speed Coaching will be available only to qualified trainees (regular runners and walkers) at the
        discretion of speed coaches. These workouts will happen once a week - time, location and qualification process
        details to follow soon.
